# Pathfinding Algorithm

## General Description

The goal of this project is to create a program that finds the shortest path between two points while avoiding any barriers.

## Skills Gained

This project is a great opportunity to practice designing, implementing, and visualizing pathfinding algorithms, which are commonly used in robotics.
